I build things. Then I rebuild them better.

I’m a 2nd year CSE student with 3-4 years of web development experience and about a year deep into Linux tinkering. Most of what I know didn’t come from lectures. It came from breaking systems at 1 AM and fixing them at 3 AM.

If something works, I want to know *why*.
If something is bloated, I replace it.
If something feels slow, I optimize it.

I don’t like magic. I like understanding.

Most of you can already guess, this stupid intro was improvised by an LLM.

## My Natural Habitat

You’ll usually find me inside:

- **Arch Linux** -> because if I’m using it, I want control.
- **Neovim** -> because IDEs should bend to me, not the other way around.
- **Hyprland** -> because aesthetics and performance can coexist.
- Random dotfiles I’m rewriting for the 17th time.

Custom workflows > default everything.

## What I Actually Care About

Nothing.. Absolutely nothing.

If something peaks my interest, I explore it properly.

## Projects That Escaped My Laptop

- **Desktop Dots**
  My Arch + Hyprland setup. Rofi scripts, quickshell utilities, terminal tweaks, and a questionable amount of time spent on aesthetics.

- **HyprHalt**
  A Hyprland exit utility. Does what it needs to. No drama.

- **Inner Ink**
  An old diary app I still want to revive properly someday. It deserves better than its current state.

There’s more coming. Always.

## The Philosophy

I believe in:

- Reading docs instead of 14 blog posts.
- Shipping things that make sense.
- Building in public when possible.
- Improving incrementally instead of waiting for perfection.

Also: keyboards matter more than most people think.

This blog exists to document what I’m learning, building, and occasionally over-optimizing.

No filler content.
Just progress.
