Welcome to my digital corner. I'm a **developer** and **student** passionate about technology, video games, and building things that live on the internet.

## Who am I?

My name is Andrés, and for as long as I can remember, I've always been curious about how things work — from taking apart toys as a kid to dissecting other people's code at 2 AM. I'm currently studying engineering while developing projects that challenge me to learn something new every day.

When I'm not coding, I'm probably in some virtual world exploring maps, completing quests, or competing online. Video games aren't just my hobby; they've also taught me how to solve problems, work in teams, and above all, not to give up after attempt #847.

## What I do

- **Web development** — I love building modern web experiences with technologies like Astro, React, TypeScript, and everything the JavaScript ecosystem has to offer.
- **Open Source** — I believe in the power of open source. You can find my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/0xdres/).
- **Continuous learning** — I'm always exploring new tools, frameworks, and concepts. Technology evolves fast, and I like to keep pace.

## Gaming

Video games are part of my DNA. From epic RPGs to competitive shooters, I enjoy practically any genre. It's that space where creativity meets strategy and pure fun.

## This blog

**Devosfera** was born as a space to document my journey as a developer, share what I learn, and connect with people who share the same passions. Here you'll find posts about development, technology, and the occasional random late-night reflection.

If you want to connect, feel free to find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/0xdres/), [X](https://x.com/avdyen), or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/avdyan/). It's always good to meet cool people from the community.
